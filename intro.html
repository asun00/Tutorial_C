<h1>This is a introduction c</h1>
<p>To translate, we use a program (a Unix command) called gcc. An example will be easier to understand:</p>

<p>- To create the source program, and create a new file new01.c with a text editor (gedit)</p>

<p>- Type in this file the following code</p>

<p>Don't forget to save the file. Leave the text editor open.</p>

<p>- Open a terminal, and change the directory to go to new01.c.</p>

<p>- In the terminal, type gcc new01.c -o new01</p>

<p>You just launched gcc asking it to read new01.c, translate it into instructions for the processor and put the result in a new01 file. </p>
<p>This is called compiling. If you type ls again, you will see a new01 file that did not exist before. - to run your program, stay in the terminal and type ./new01</p>
